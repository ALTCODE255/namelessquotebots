I may not seem like it, but I sometimes wish that Santa Claus actually existed. Although if he did, I'd have to arrest him for breaking and entering.
Oh, am I mistaken? I thought I heard something about delicious pancakes...
More importantly, you should never forcefully change a person's heart.
To paraphrase Hegel, advancement cannot occur without both thesis and antithesis...
Adults are only interested in using the young, while they simply do as the adults say. There are too many irresponsible people in these modern times.
Common sense can get in the way at times when pursuing the truth. Many details become logical if I think on the premise that they do exist.
Phantom thieves that use calling cards and succeed in their crime... As the so-called "Charismatic Detective," it'd be hard for me not to see them as my rivals.
Presenting oneself in a favorable light is nothing surprising. More surprising is just how innocent you seem to be.
The influence of The Phantoms knows no bounds... I underestimated it, honestly.
I bet we'd make a great team if we worked together. *chuckle*
It seems I'm unwelcome no matter where I go.
Apparently, my mother was in a relationship with some low-life of a man... She was swiftly discarded when he learned she was pregnant... That despair would lead to her death. Thanks to him, I was passed from foster home to foster home. But, I do quite well by myself these days.
I believe that fate brings people together. It's strange, but talking to you is thought-provoking.
Those unfortunate students were made victims all because adults valued their own conveniences... This is unforgivable, no matter the reason.
Welcome home.
Let's just call this my performance fee.
Mmm, it's quite deli— ...HNNNGH!?
Ngh... My throat...! Urgh! This is...! Ohhh... Oh, my stomach... it burns!
I-I-I'm... I'm fine! I just love... uh... spicy— spicy stuff... Haha... hah...
W-Well then... I'll... I'll see you... uh... t-t-t-tomorrow. 
Please don't troll me online for this interruption, okay?
Come now, there's no need for hostility. I will simply have to come to Leblanc every day in that case.
There would be no motive for them to carry out such a cruel plot. Clearly our culprit is acting behind the scenes to accomplish some grand objective. He likely has accomplices. It is even possible that he is being controlled by someone.
A long time ago, a girl from another class confessed her love for me... Oh, this isn't me bragging by the way. At the time, the only thing on my mind was how exactly I was going to turn her down.
I'm terrible, aren't I? I think so too. But, I have something that I must do...
Nobody would ever know if things got a little violent...
After all, if you wish to trick your enemies, you must first trick your allies.
Case closed... This is how your "justice" ends.
Once they lost public support, someone they thought was their greatest enemy lent a hand... That's the same strategy used in romance, wouldn't you agree?
None of these people know that I was an undesirable child. I wanted people to rely on me... I wanted to be needed... I devoted myself to my studies, acted as an honor student, and made my name as an ace detective.
If they get their hands on the perpetrator, there'll be no need for him to turn himself in, no?
If I had to explain myself, I'd say it's simply personal principle that I repay my debts.

# P5R Thieves Den
Am I the only sane person here?
By the way, the real Captain Kidd was publicly executed. They left his body hanging there for years on end.
Ha. And? It's their fault for being stupid enough to fall for the act.
He nearly ruined your lives, right? You should have gotten even and taken everything from him... including his life.
Rather than letting him live out the last few years of his pitiful life, why not put him out of his misery?
Is that so? Well, you stop feeling things once you get used to it.
So... It appears you made good on our deal. Don't expect any thanks, though. If you hadn't interfered, everything would've gone exactly as I'd planned.
No matter the rationale, it doesn't change the fact that he was a rotten piece of shit of a father. Besides, I have no interest in wasting time empathizing with him after all he put me through.
You worked so hard for the sake of others, only to find out they didn't want your help. I'm sure even you must have lost faith in humanity at that point.
So, this is the Shadow that stalks Mementos... Is it the root of all human fear? A core desire of the id? A warning from the superego of Mementos? I suppose it could be many things, but in the end, this is all mere speculation.
You're so naīve. Trying to be a good person only gets you taken advantage of. You'd be a perfect target for scammers.
With this much attention on me, I need to constantly consider how the audience and media will interpret my words.
Sometimes, calling an idiot an idiot is the kindest thing you can do.

# P5R Confidant
I'm rather dextrous with my right hand. I can even use chopsticks with it.
I think you'd be an interesting influence on me. If you're so inclined, we could go out again sometime.
It's a nice idea... I'd like to try a match where I don't have to hold anything back.
If you ever manage to win against me using my right hand, then I will face you with everything I have. You have my word.

As far as I'm concerned, anyone in my company must meet their standards of intelligence and attractiveness... But you? I expect you'll pass muster easily.
Well, I don't hate sweets, but I'm not exactly partial to them...
Uh-oh. Looks like I've been spotted.
A shame I don't have glasses like you. Maybe I would have been able to get out of this situation.
Huh? Hey, what are you—!?
I suppose I'd better learn to watch what I say around you.
Any interest in becoming my stunt double? You can dress up as me. You and I aren't terribly different in height. I'm sure my clothes would fit you.
Nobody would notice the switch, I'm sure. We proved it today—most people can't see beyond the superficial.

Work and obligation take me to quite a few restaurants and cafés, but this place is a little more special to me. I guess you could call it my go-to place.
Though I have to say, I'm envious. You must be quite well-stocked on coffee and curry.
Even my efforts in cooking class have been underwhelming. In particular, an attempt to fillet a fish went... poorly.
I usually come here when I need some time to really think on my own.
You know, you're the first person I've ever brought here... It's not like I was keeping it from anyone, but... I suppose it goes to show we do have some strange connection.
Certainly the point of jazz is all those jam sessions. A sea of improvisation, both complex and organic... As each player incorporates their own flavors, a natural melody is born from the chaos.
Somehow I always end up talking more than usual when it's with you.

Ah, you noticed? Well, I'll need as much practice as I can get if I'm going to take you out.
I had a toy gun like this when I was young, you know. All this reminded me of running around the house with it, playing hero...
There are different kinds of heroes, of course. Different stances they define themselves by. For example, one may stick to the justice they believe in, even if others deny it... While another may simply do as others desire of them, seeking to be recognized and gratified as a hero.
But if nobody else wants the justice they fight for, isn't that just blind self-righteousness?
Ah sorry, I suppose that was a strange tangent... Pardon me. Whenever I talk to you, I just can't help delving into these abstract topics...
There's this... constant pressure. Everyone expects me to be capable of anything, which is stressful in and of itself.
...Still, games are rather fun. It was quite a novel experience... Usually, I just read in my leisure time.
Usually I really struggle with enjoying the same pastimes as my peers, but thanks to you, I had fun today.

Of course, these days I'm the Detective Prince, but my family situation was... well, complicated.
By the time I was old enough to realize it, my father was already gone. My mother was all I had.
My mother worked at a nightclub. Whenever she had to bring a man home, she'd send me off to the local bathhouse.
It's in the past. I have no reason to blame her either. The only one who deserves blame is my father. The worthless, degenerate excuse for a man who abandoned my mother. I wanted to force him to finally give her the apology he owes her, but... that's no longer possible.
Oh, I'm just getting warmed up. Don't go overheating, now. I wouldn't want you to collapse on my account.
Oof... I think I feel a little lightheaded.
Haha, I thought so. Your face is bright red, you know.
I've never told anyone else about my family situation, either. I wonder why I told you? Curious indeed.
Now that you mention it, maybe we are pretty similar deep down... We're both victims of the adults who unfairly impacted our lives.
This probably isn't a conversation we should be having naked. Let's get dressed, shall we?
...Though we could always see who changes faster. First to leave wins. Are you ready?
Between the delicious coffee and the bath, I finally managed to relax. So... thank you.
It's nice to spend the day as Goro Akechi for once, rather than the Detective Prince. You know?
I don't know if it's because of the whole Prince image, but everyone seems to think I'm some brilliant prodigy. It's really nothing like that. But people always seem to misunderstand.
If they saw how I was acting today, perhaps they'd say I wasn't acting like the Detective Prince.
But I suppose you're the only one who sees that side of me. Nobody else particularly needs to, anyway.
Honestly, though... I just can't figure you out, no matter how I try. You and I have common ground in some aspects, but in others, we're total opposites. It's intriguing. The more I get to know you, the more it makes me think. I wonder why that is.

And the most interesting part is that it has so many parallels to a theoretical "perfect crime."
You eliminate your target without ever directly connecting yourself to it. I don't suppose that rings any bells?
Everything that happens around us, every little inconsequential event, may simply be one ball striking another. But there's no guarantee that the ball can be precisely controlled.
And despite the player's best intentions, the ball may strike many unrelated obstacles in its path. Even then... do you still intend to play this game?
We are both victims of unjust adults. And now, we have the will and power to rise up against them.
But even that united front will soon end. And after that, everything will return to the way it was, no?
Why not join me instead...? All you'd have to do is abandon the teammates you have now.
I'd advise you don't say these things without their due consideration. You shouldn't make promises that you can't keep, anyway.
*chuckle* You truly are intriguing.
I think a relationship of equals suits us better than being co-conspirators, anyway... No matter what else may change.
In any case, what you just said carries great weight. Remember what you decided, and don't run from it. All right?
Neither of us can afford to lose, because we fight in service of our principles. And that is precisely why... I cannot allow you to change. As you are now, as you think now... I cannot allow you to win over me.

Remember what I told you? If you ever won against me using my right hand, I'd take you on with everything I've got.
Your insight allowing you to determine my dominant hand, your quick wit, and most of all, how fast you've grown... You've exceeded my expectations in every way. Thus, I've built up this urge to duel you without holding anything back.
...Maybe I've misjudged you all this time. I really wish you weren't such a disappointment to me...
Anyway, I'll continue to wait in Shibuya from tomorrow on. If you want a rematch, I'll accept as many times as you please. That is, if you're up to the task.
In all honesty, I'd love to see just how far we can go...
But, we have an important mission coming up. Until that's finished, you're a vital ally to me.
I'm going to be entirely honest with you: I hate you.
Your deft handling of your unfortunate circumstances, your uniqueness, your ability to surpass me—all these irritate me. You're the one person I refuse to lose to.
You really are— No, never mind.
I'll let you have this win today, but next time, I will be victorious. Let this be my proof.
There's a tradition in the West to throw one's glove at their opponent when demanding a duel. Should the opponent accept the glove, the duel is also accepted.
Make certain that you will never forget: I am the one who will defeat you.

# P5(R): Engine Room
You truly are interesting... Quiet, yet possessing the courage and determination to take action.
Under different circumstances, we could have been great rivals... or perhaps even friends.
You don't allow yourself to be enslaved by such things as human relations or past selves... And so, your heart is always free. The exact opposite of mine. To be honest, I'm envious...
I wonder why we couldn't have met a few years earlier, Ren...
All this is to make Masayoshi Shido... my father... acknowledge me. Then exact revenge on him.
So I'm his bastard child. My very existence is nothing but a scandal... My mother's life turned for the worst after she had me... and died. I was a cursed child for her too.
Once he reaches the apex of his power and acknowledges me, I'm going to whisper in his ear... I will tell him the truth of who I really am! And that's when I—an utter disgrace to the world—will rule over him, I will prevail!
In just a few weeks, my plan would have come to fruition... but no, you just had to interfere!
I am going to personally thrust Masayoshi Shido into a living hell.
So, Joker... rest easy and die.

Even the feeblest existence can gain tremendous power once the chains on its heart are broken.
I wouldn't give up my chance to massacre you with my own two hands...!
*chuckle* So... neither of us had shown our true strengths, huh...?
Teammates!? Friends!? To hell with that! Why am I inferior to you!? I was extremely particular about my life, my grades, my public image, so someone would want me around!
I am an ace detective... A celebrity! But you... you're just some criminal trash living in an attic! So, how... How does someone like you have things I don't!? How can such a worthless piece of trash be more special than me!?
Don't give me that cliché bullshit!
This argument is meaningless!
You're not satisfied with where we left it either, are you? Isn't this what you really wanted? You and I are going to strike and strike until one of us is dead! To hell with holding back!

Don't make me laugh! Justice? Righteous?! Keep that shit to yourselves! You and your teammates piss me off!
Why are you... looking at me like that...!? I've... I've succeeded until now... all by myself...! I don't need... teammates... I don't...

...You're so lucky. Lucky to be surrounded... by teammates who acknowledge you.
And once Shido confesses his crimes, you'll all be heroes. As for me, people will find out my past deductions were just charade. My fame and trust will vanish.
In the end... I couldn't be special...
...Are you all idiots? You should get rid of me... if you don't want me getting in your way.
...You all are truly beyond my comprehension.

Haha... I was such a fool.
...Don't misunderstand. You're the one who's going to disappear!
Let's make a deal, okay? You won't say no, will you?
Change Shido's heart... in my stead... End his crimes... Please!
Heh... After all this, that's what you have to say? Seriously, you really are...
So, my final enemy is a puppet version of myself... I...!

# P5R: Third Semester
We have greater concerns right now. In fact, I'm a bit offended you think so little of me that you expected me to be dead.
For the time being, you seem to be the only one who's still in their right frame of mind.
For the time being, you and I share the same goal. To solve this problem, don't you agree that it'd be safer for us to partner up?
...Do you even understand what the word "cooperate" means?
Now that we've made ourselves a new deal, you wouldn't turn me down, would you?
We just happened to be together when he got your call.
First, a dead woman returns, and now a Palace appears... How intriguing.
Allow me to stop you there—I'm not a part of the Phantom Thieves.
Yoshizawa-san aside, there's no reason for me to uphold the pretense of a righteous, sincere Detective Prince.
What say we save the idle chatter for later and keep moving? Unless teaming up with a "ruthless sort of person" is too much for you to handle.
And I refuse to live like that. I'll be the one to choose my path. That's how I've lived up to now, and it's going to continue from here 'til the end.
That's quite the funny joke. It makes me want to puke.
Heh, not bad for an improvised technique.
There's no need to be defensive. Had I wished to kill you all, I would've simply done so already.
Enough of this high-and-mighty bullshit! You're pissing me off!
We hesitate right now—we die!
I'm a bit occupied, so do your goddamn JOB!

What, you came just to see me? Just the sort of brainless sentimentality I'd expect from you.
I don't mind acting under a fake personality, but nothing beats being able to act freely...
What, you like this place that much? I guess I understand how you feel.
I'm glad you're still normal, even in this bizarre situation. If you'd lost it too... Well, if that happened, I would have slapped you awake.
Mind I propose a simple solution? Why study humans at all? Why not just give it up?
Tch. You simpleton...
It's fine if you aren't worried, but you're gonna get burned if you get carried away.

# P5R: Third Semester Mementos
Pancakes... I don't want to hear that word again for a long, long time.
I enjoy spending time in Kichijoji. It's not very big, but there are plenty of trendy shops.
This place is immense. If there weren't train tracks everywhere, I'd bring my bike here.
Do you prefer my previous outfit or this one? Moving around's become much easier for me.
You think I'm frightening when I fight? Well, I'm afraid you're just going to have to accept it.
I meant to tell you, regarding Shido... Thank you for keeping your promise.
You may not like working with me, but I'm counting on your assistance until our goal is achieved.
If you're looking for a way to train your mind and your body, I highly recommend bouldering.
A world that panders to your every whim is so mundane. Where's the thrill if there's no competition?

# P5R: Third Semester In-Battle
Let's do this, Joker...
I'm getting a warm, tingly feeling from all this power!
Hm, you— I mean we… can do better.
Joker, if you die now, I... I'll kill you again myself!
Hey Joker, instead of dying, how about we crush them together!?
Joker's enraged? I kind of like it, but it's not you! Calm down!
Joker's more brainwashed than a cult member! He can't tell friend from foe!
Joker's mind is muddled! He might do weird stuff while confused!
Zzz...
Aaiiee! I-I don't want to do this scary shit anymore!
You're all my enemies! No, I am NOT brainwashed!
Guys... don't you see? There's no hope... we're going to die here...
Persona? What's that? Damn, I can't remember...
Uh... Where am I?
This one just got betrayed by its teammate! Ha, imagine how that feels!

# P5R: February 2nd
Don't tell me you think dangling my life before us is going to have any impact on our decision.
...I will carve my own path for myself. I refuse to accept a reality concocted by someone else, stuck under their control for the rest of my days.
So what? That's the path I chose.
Don't ask such stupid questions after all this time. All you have to do is stick to your guns and challenge Maruki.
Or, are you really so spineless that you'd fold over some bullshit, trivial threat on my life?
Do you think I'd be happy with this? Being shown mercy now, of all times? I don't want to be pitied—this isn't something I'm debating with you!
Your indecisiveness on the matter is essentially a betrayal of my wishes.
Then you already know what needs to be done.
...I want to hear you say it aloud. What do you intend to do?
I won't wait a moment longer. Answer me.
I will never accept this form of reality. I'm done being manipulated.
Let's go back... to our true reality.
What's a life worth in a reality that was cooked up just to satisfy someone else? I say none.
...Well, I have your answer.
There's nothing left I can say. Our deal's off.

# P5D
I, Crow... shall dance for you!
What... just what are you, damn it!?
Who made you the special one!?
This is fun, right? FUN!
I don't believe it... what the hell are you?
What are you...? MONSTERS?!
Is that all you've really got? ...Ha.
Farewell... Let's meet again if we get the chance.
I won't lose... If I ever lost, I'd—!
Everyone look! It's a new high score!

# P5A
Sorry it took me so long. I'm here to rescue you. Is that what you thought I'd say?
Get going, you white knights.
What's wrong? Get up. It's too early for checkmate, isn't it?

# P5T
And so you know: attempts at manipulation put me in a bad mood.
That's quite an amusing joke. Well done.
If I may be frank, you're highly delusional.

# Unused Navigation Lines (Detective Prince)
You ARE Phantom Thieves, aren't you? And you can't do a better job of avoiding Shadows than this?
Why are you drawing the attention of all these Shadows?! Trying to make new friends or something?
You're still not turning back despite how bad it's gotten here?! You're either very brave or very stupid.

# Unused Costume Dialogue
Joker... Why exactly did you have me change into my swimsuit? I understand that it grants better mobility, but... Surely it's common sense to not wear one here of all places?
This is the bartender's outfit, apparently. Sorry, but I can't serve any alcohol. I suppose I could serve you all juice... Either that or a soft cocktail. I know a good place in Kichijoji.
If you were a woman, I'd call you princess... but I suppose in this case, I'll call you Master.
What is it? Why are you staring at me like that...? I put on this outfit because you asked me to... But isn't this more like a clown outfit? Hey! I can see you laughing!
Having "HERO" on the hat suits me quite well, considering justice and all of that. Don't you think it's perfect for me?
I don't usually wear clothes like this, so I can't help but be a little embarrassed. But, I won't lose to you, not even in dance.
I am Phoenix Ranger Neo-Featherman, Feather Silver. Ah, this takes me back. I used to watch it when I was little. Funny in hindsight. It's always the team's most recent ally who seems to be the strongest of the bunch, isn't it?
Isn't this amazing? It may look strange, but it's actually quite comfortable. I'm surprised you could tell it was me. Or, wait... Perhaps you didn't recognize me after all?
Is that your clothing for the winter? Hm. It has a similar feeling to mine.
Hm? Is that... your swimwear? Well, as long as you're able to fight in that... It's a bit distracting, though. Just keep the messing around to a minimum.
I'm so used to seeing you in black, but you look nice in pale colors as well... I have to admit I'm a little jealous.
Oh, Joker. You're in a butler outfit. If you're a butler, I suppose I'll ask you for something... Just kidding.
A Santa costume? What's gotten into you, Joker? I suppose letting loose is still important. Are you going to ask for what I want? Hmm... If that's the case... I'd like to continue competing against you.
Well, even if it's a dance competition, I won't lose. Even detectives should be able to dance elegantly.
Perhaps we should have a dance competition this time? Only kidding. I don't have much experience with dancing anyhow.
That's from Phoenix Ranger Neo-Featherman, correct? They're heroes admired by children, and despite its age, the show is still quite popular. But, you might want to consider cutting back on cosplaying. You're not a child anymore.
Joker, what are you wearing? I suppose it's a custom made costume, but it makes you seem quite different than usual. Actually, can you even see me in there? ...Joker? Heeey!

# Unused Sae Palace Poker Scene
All I can do... is wish you good luck.
Despite the common view that black cats are a sign of misfortune, some believe they bring good luck. I wonder which side of the coin you represent for me?
I wish to place my bets on your being a good luck cat.

# Unused P5R Alternative Third Awakening Scene
Nostalgic, eh? You very well could be right. I'm remembering things that are a bit too bitter for me, though...
At any rate, I want to thank you about the deal we made on the "ship".
Boy, you're honest to a fault, aren't you?
For so, so long, I've wanted to crush him... But it seems you took care of that for me.
Sorry, but I don't see it as a favor to me. If anything, it's the exact opposite. After all, I lost my one shot at revenge.
I know this isn't the reaction I'd usually have... But it's how I feel, so there's nothing I can do about it.
Your straightforwardness is quite aggressive. Actually, it's to the point of irritation. I genuinely cannot comprehend how you live your life like that.
You still have my glove, right? Don't think I've forgotten about that. I simply can't lose to you again.

# Unused P5R Darts Dialogue
What the hell does that even mean...
...Don't look at me like that.
I don't need you to tell me that. I'm always calm.

# Unused P5R Mementos Request
I have to say, though... It was astounding to see you all so ready to accept the victim as some blameless paragon of virtue.
Not everyone has the luxury of being heroes of their own story. If you let yourself trust other people that easily, that blindly, it's going to get you hurt someday.
These things happen all the time. It really shouldn't be that surprising. That's just the world we live in.
Didn't I just tell you? Nothing good can come of keeping faith in people who haven't earned it.
