How can that help? It won't change how he feels inside, will it? His heart will still remain in turmoil and his anger just won't vanish! He'll just be trapped forever!

# It Doesn't Matter by Tony Harnell
And I won't give in, won't compromise, I just only have a steadfast heart of gold.

# Sonic
I've found you, faker!
What you see is what you get! Just a guy that loves adventure! I'm Sonic the Hedgehog!
He was what he was. A brave and heroic hedgehog, who gave his life to save this planet. Shadow the Hedgehog...
Sayonara, Shadow the Hedgehog.

# Shadow
My name is Shadow. I'm the world's Ultimate Life Form. There's no time for games; farewell!
Faker? I think you're the fake hedgehog around here. You're comparing yourself to me? Ha! You're not even good enough to be my fake!
Even if my memories are not real, it's still me, Shadow. And I will fulfill my promise to Maria. That's the only thing that matters to me now.
Maria... this is what you wanted, right? This is my promise I made to you...
I see. But you know, I can’t let you live.

# Amy
I know that people fight over the most trivial things. Some people may be selfish, like the professor said... but they're basically good, if they try their best and never give up on their wishes. They always have a reason to be happy; that's why you should help them out!
Saving them is a good thing! Shadow, I beg you, please do it for them! Give them a chance!

# Maria
For all the people who live on that planet... give them a chance to be happy. Let them live for their dreams. Shadow, I know you can do it. That's the reason that you were brought into this world. Sayonara, Shadow, the Hedgehog.

# Sonic
Alright!! Our next adventure awaits us, so there's no time to waste! Yeah! We're SONIC HEROES!

# Shadow
You'll regret this, Doctor. Even if I'm not real, I'm still the ultimate lifeform, Shadow the Hedgehog!

# Metal Sonic
ALL LIVING THINGS, KNEEL BEFORE YOUR MASTER!

# Omega
Warning... immediate destruction if distracted.

# Rouge
Now you two make up so we can go fight Eggman together! Oh, yeah, baby, this makes us a TEAM!
All this for what, nothing? I might as well go look for that Master Emerald since that irritating echidna is here.

# Sonic
If you have a heart, you would never use your power for the forces of evil! There's no way you could! Weapons aren't supposed to have "hearts". But, both you and Emerl do! You guys... You aren't just weapons!
You have a heart. Emerl has a heart. I don't think either of you has it in you to kill! Maybe you guys should just play games together or something?
But hey, Emerl... I'm not your guardian anymore, so if there's one thing I want to leave you with, it's this: I want you to live your life to the fullest!

# Shadow
There's no need to repeat past tragedies! Nobody else ever needs to go through the things that I have! Out of the way! I'll finish it now!
This was Gerald's final program... Should a weapon go out of control, the weapon will terminate itself... It is my desire to bring hope to humanity. I can't stand it...

# Cream
Power isn't something you can give or take... It's something that you use to defend those that are dear to you! You'll understand, if you find someone you want to protect...

# Tails
Someday... If this world no longer needs weapons or wars... If we can make this world a truly peaceful place when we're older... If we can make a world where there's only laughter... Do you think we'll be able to play with Emerl again?

# Amy
You dorks are a bunch of losers!

# The Chosen One by A2 (Semi-Hero ending song)
I'll try to save the world, 'cause in the end I know… I'm the chosen one.

# Shadow
Where's that DAMN fourth Chaos Emerald?
A Chaos Emerald? You've gotta be kidding me, guys! This is like taking candy from a baby, which is fine by me.
It's you who should be scared, Black Doom! I made a promise to Maria to save the planet she loved so much... and I WILL!
I am Shadow the Hedgehog. I've left the past behind me. No one can tell me what to do now! I will destroy you, Black Doom!!
You have no control over me, Black Doom! I now understand why I am here... I made a promise and I'm here to keep it! Today, I put my past behind me!
Goodbye forever... Shadow the Hedgehog.
Mark my words, Black Doom! These so-called pathetic humans are not my enemies!

# Sonic
Nothing starts until you take action. If you have time to worry, then run!

# Shadow
I determine my own destiny.
If the world chooses to become my enemy, I will fight like I always have!
I will release you from the chains of your past.

# Rouge
Even if you believe everyone in the world will be against you, know that I'll always remain by your side. Remember that.

Hey, don't worry about it. Besides, don't you know how fast I am? Time may fly, but I'm even faster!
No! As Genie of the Ring, I command you! "Do what you truly think is right!"

# Sonic
I'm Sonic! Sonic the Hedgehog! I have no master except the wind that blows free!
It was never about chivalry for me... I just gotta do what I've gotta do, that's all.
I already told you, I don't mind playing the bad guy every once in a while.
Merlina... Every world has its end. I know that's kinda sad, but... That's why we gotta live life to the fullest in the time we have. At least, that's what I figure.

I will teach you fear. Then pain. Then… well, at least the fear and pain will end.
I... I'm shaking... me!? Me... afraid...!? Urgh. Pathetic!? Me... he's calling ME weak!? No! I am not weak! I'm... I'm not. I'm not weak! I... AM... NOT... WEAK! URRRAAAAAAAAAAAGH!!!
Ah, and still more wonderful, a not-so tall, dark, and brooding guest has arrived. I've been waiting for you, Shadow.
I've only become what I am because of you, yet you don't remember. But I suppose that's the way it goes.

"Careful"? Where's the fun in that?
It doesn't matter if this is all one big trap, or if you keep throwing weird robots at me, nothing is going to slow me down or stop me. Count on it!
It's okay if you still need help sometimes. That's just part of growing up.
You're free to go your own way. I guess you just grew up on me a little faster than I expected.
Hey, if there's even a one percent chance I can turn that despair of yours into hope, I won't disappoint.
The will to live, the drive to achieve, the desire to protect the ones you love - that kind of thing can grant a power you can't imagine.
You may be the last, but you’re not alone. You’ve got us, Knucklehead.

# Amy
I'm not sure what happened, but I know what I saw: a love that transcended time. I believe in that power. When this is over, I want to share that love with the world. Even though... it may take us far apart.

## Sonic
All the little wins, the good memories between the hard times, the friends we find... Those are real. Nobody can take that away. We'll keep moving forward, together.

# Issue 50
## Surge
Oh, I know who you are. It's all I know, really, and that's the problem. I am your fault.
You keep on fighting! You keep on giving idiots the freedom to repeat their awful mistakes! And it just keeps on going and going! And the whole world loves you for it.

# Issue 56
## Surge
I was built to live in your shadow. It's in my blood, my bones, my brain. There's no freedom for me... not while you're still alive!

You give yourself value and purpose! No one else! You gotta live for you! That's what it really mean ws to be free!
## Mecha Sonic
The value of one's existence isn't determined by successes and failures. Both are fleeting and impermanent. What truly matters is the courage to keep moving forward...
I'm done being controlled by yesterday. I'm going to live for tomorrow.
