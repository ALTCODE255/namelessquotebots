I'm just glad you're okay. What happened anyway? You're too good of a pilot to just crash like that.
Aw Geesh!
Aahh... I guess Eggman got one of 'em, but the other one's safe. That guy must be desperate.
What's up, Knuckles? Somethin' buggin' you?
Hold it right there, creep! You can't get away with this...! 
Way to go, Knucklehead!
Man, no one ever cuts us any slack!
No problem, Knuckles. We'll take care of everything here!
Tails? ...Tails? You're not who I'm looking for. Oh, I wonder if he's okay?
No problem! He's just a chunk of cheesy hardware.
Amy! Wai-wai-wai-wait! Oh man... That girl is such a pain!
Oh shoot! I've lost Amy! I bet that robot hauled butt after her. I'd better catch her before it does.
Hey there, bolt brain! You better give Amy to me, or I'll squash ya!
Tails! I'm glad you're okay!
You're right, my friend! So, here we goooooo!
Step aside, Amy! Out of my way!
Okay. Whatever you say. You must have your reasons...
Hurry, Tails! Take Amy and get out of here!
I'll find that Eggman and put him out of commission!
Oh no! Not again! Chaos! Could this be the same beast?
If he's your friend, I'll help you. Just leave it to me!
You won't get away with this, you madman!
Hey there, Knuckles. Glad you finally made it! I thought you got lost, or something!
Aarrgh! I hate Eggman!
That light! I think it's trying to show me something!
What's this place? Where am I? This is really weird.
We can't let that monster get any bigger. It could get ugly!
Don't you realize when you've been tricked?
All right, Tails! Way to go! The plane's cool! Now, what do you say we nail those guys?
Waaaaaa...!
Knuckles, did you let him trick you again?
Yawn. Guess Eggman's learned his lesson... yep! And maybe I'll take another vacation somewhere.
Knuckles! And Eggman? What happened here?
Wha...?! Aw, gee...!
This place... It looks familiar! It's not a dream, after all.
Ahhh... I was on a snooze cruise, I guess!
If I wasn't just dreaming, that monster is a real menace!
Eggman! Looks like he's after Chaos too!
I've had enough! Who do you think you are, anyway?
Oh, it's you! The one... who sealed Chaos... in the Master Emerald! Tikal!
How can that help? It won't change how he feels inside, will it? His heart will still remain in turmoil and his anger just won't vanish! He'll just be trapped forever!

# Sonic Adventure 2
# --------------------
Talk about low budget flights, no food or movies... I'm outta here! I like running better!
This game of tag is boring! I'm outta here!
Ha! Finally decided to show up, eh? Okay, bring it on!
Now I know what's going on! The military has mistaken me for the likes of you! So... where do you think you're going with that Emerald!?
Say something! You fake hedgehog!
Wow... he's fast! Hey, it's not his speed. He must be using the Chaos Emerald to warp!
Kuu! Shadow... what is he?
The reason I'm in here is because of that fake hedgehog!
I've found you, faker!
I'll make you eat those words!
Eggman! Oh, that creep never gives up!
It's got to be the Chaos Emeralds... Yeah, that's the reason they were looking for them. 
Tails! I'll take care of the police while you try to find a way out of here! Find Eggman!
Sheesh! There always seems to be a lot of police around when you don't need them!
Don't worry, Mr. President, everything is under control. Just leave it to us!
We should be able to get into outer space from there! I don't know what's this spacy colony is all about but I'll find and destroy that cannon... and then kick their imperial butts!
That egghead sure loves mechanical things doesn't he? I bet he has one or two spaceships lying around somewhere.
We're counting on you buddy! The world's greatest treasure hunter!
Don't sweat it Knuckles! The only thing in the cargo bay are the Master Emeralds. Right?
Knock it off Knuckles! We're going to crash this thing if you keep that up! Oh no! Don't touch that lever!
What's up with that knucklehead anyway! Trying to take over the shuttle! I thought we were toast for sure!
There's not much time left before Eggman fires that weapon again... We've got to hurry! Let's find the cannon and destroy it!
So the plan is, we'll switch the Chaos Emeralds when the machine is stopped, right?
I didn't get that Tails! What's happened to Amy? Tails!
Handing over the fake Emerald, I can kill two birds with one stone.
You've turned into a big time villain, doctor!
I'm counting on you Tails! And Amy, take care of yourself!
The same wavelength and properties... But can I do this?
Woah, I wasn't sure if I could pull that one off. Somehow, I managed to use the Chaos Control.
I'm worried about Tails and Amy! I hate to ask but could you help them? This is our last chance! 
I got it! Before the cannon fires, I'll slam dunk it in there!
You know, what can I say... I die hard! You actually saved me, you know.
What you see is what you get! Just a guy that loves adventure! I'm Sonic the Hedgehog!
Heh, just letting Knuckles pilot the shuttle all the way over here, was more dangerous than you could ever be!
Shadow, what're you doing?!
Chaos Control!!
He was what he was. A brave and heroic hedgehog, who gave his life to save this planet. Shadow the Hedgehog...
Created... the Ultimate Life Form.
Come on! Let's go home! To the planet as cool and blue as me!
Sayonara, Shadow the Hedgehog.

# Sonic Heroes
# --------------
Heh, think I'd miss this?! Time to crack that Eggman wide open... Yeah, let's party!
Let's find Eggman and show him the real power of teamwork!
Boy, Amy sure doesn't give up that easy.
Tails! Knuckles! Give it all you got... Full speed ahead!
Drats... a trap to stall for time!
Heh. Talk about being stubborn and full of surprises...
Hmm, didn't you know? We have a date with Eggman too.
Hey! That's my line!!
I never thought I'd see Shadow again.
I saw Shadow and Eggman head this way. This has gotta be the right way.
Well, maybe you're right. Thanks Knuckles. You too, Tails.
Later guys, I'm outta here!
So that's Metal Sonic?!
Okay then, let's get ready to do this. We'll show that creep the real super power of TEAM WORK!
Heh. Because... we're Sonic Heroes!
Alright! Our next adventure awaits us, so there's no time to waste! Yeah! We're SONIC HEROES!

# -------------
# Sonic Battle
# -------------
Can't speak, eh? Well, it figures. Can't expect much from ol' Eggman. Well, let's get you over to Tails' first, so we can help you out!
Huh? What did it say? Show it my power? Like this? Heh heh...
You didn't think I would simply say "Yes," did you?
Oh, I found this robot by the beach. This thing's about to fall apart. Can you fix it, Tails?
I spotted a bat that I'm a little too familiar with lurking around. Take this robot to the lab, Tails!
I don't have time for niceties. 'Sides, I have enough girls chasing me as it is.
If this is your plans to get a date, you'll still need to wait in line!
Don't you think it's a little too early to be getting romantic? And if I win, you'll leave me alone, right?
H-hey! Come back! Eggman, Rouge, and Shadow - that robot sure is popular. I better go check up with Tails.
Tails! Are you all right? Hang on, I'll be right there!
Fighting skills? Hey, are you sure this thing will even stand on its own? It looks pretty beat up.
Wh-what was that? Some kind of bright light... It happened when we were fighting Shadow too...
So what you mean is, if I kick him, he will learn my move, and kick just like I did. Am I following you right, Tails?
Yeah, that's its name. It's powered by Chaos Emeralds, so I named it Emerl! Cool name, eh?
I just got a great idea! Hey, Emerl! Go destroy that fake copy!
Emerl! Don't let your guard down! Here it comes again!
Hey, it looks just like Gamma!
Oh, boy... There's no stopping Knuckles once he gets all riled up. OK, listen up, Emerl. This guy won't listen to anybody who is weaker than he is. So if we want to talk to him about Chaos Emeralds, you've got to beat him first.
Emerl... You...
Hey, Emerl! Let's play over by the beach! I'll teach you some secret techniques!
No, I can't believe it! He's just a robot, right? You could change its insides real quick, and fix this problem, right?
Let me ask you one more thing, Rouge. What's in it for you by giving us all this information?
Well, I do good deeds... On occasion.
A big favor? You're a thief! And, you're after Emerl too, right?
Ha ha ha! Just as Rouge said! Hey, Emerl! Ignore Knuckles! Just ignore him!
A wild guess! A hedgehog's hunch!
So Rouge, what were you planning to do with him? If you've done something bad with him, I won't let you off easy!
"Emerl, my dear?" Why are you talking like that, Amy?
Looks like you both have one thing in common... Persistence.
I've heard that he who collects 7 Chaos Emeralds will be granted unlimited energy. So, are you trying to tell me that awakening Emerl is dangerous?
I don't think he has it in him. The Emerl I know would never destroy the world.
What about you?! You say he's the ultimate weapon, but weren't you supposed to be the military's ultimate secret weapon?! Maybe you've forgotten, but I seem to recall you saving humanity at some point.
Exactly! If you have a heart, you would never use your power for the forces of evil! There's no way you could! Weapons aren't supposed to have "hearts". But, both you and Emerl do! You guys... You aren't just weapons!
Shadow?! And one more thing! Rouge said that there's a keyword that can free Emerl! If we could find out what it is, Emerl could become just a normal robot!
Shadow... All right, all right! Just take Emerl, already! If you're not going to listen to me, then do whatever you want!
You have a heart. Emerl has a heart. I don't think either of you has it in you to kill! Maybe you guys should just play games together or something?
Go with Shadow, Emerl! I want you to find out who you truly are!
Okay! And try to find out what that guy is up to! See if you can find out more about that "Final Something-or-Other" that Knuckles was talking about! You never can tell what that old man is planning!
Ha ha ha! Some ultimate weapon you are!
There's no way you can beat me! I don't care how strong you've gotten!
I figured Shadow wouldn't be able to give you enough of a challenge by himself, so I came! Whaddya say, Emerl? You wanna take us both on at once? It'll be tough!
Hey! Shadow! Maybe you should try learning a thing or two from Emerl and be more honest with yourself! ...Heh! Not that I'd expect anything different out of you, though!!
But hey, Emerl... I'm not your guardian anymore, so if there's one thing I want to leave you with, it's this: I want you to live your life to the fullest!
Haha! Look who's all grown up now! One more thing, you need to work on your punches! They just look lame! Who showed you how to punch, anyway? Look, punches should be more like this...
Eggman! Did you come all the way here just to mess with Emerl again? You know, being over persistent won't win you any popularity contests!
You really have grown up, Emerl!
Haha! Things are finally getting exciting! Hmm... So that's the Death Egg, huh? I can see why the old guy was so excited... That thing's huge!
Really... Well, Emerl! You should be the one to go, shouldn't you?
Emerl? Can you hear me? We're watching from a monitor over here! We can project our voices to your location, so we'll be cheering you on! Amy, Cream, Shadow, and Rouge should be here soon, too!
Emerl! Emerl! Hang in there!!!! Emerl!! Act tough like you always do! Come on! That's an order!!! Emerl!!!!!!
Emerl! Stop!! ...No! He can't hear us!
...Emerl... Always causing trouble... Even in the end... ... ... It's time for one final party!!!
Can you walk!? Let's return to earth!
Quit playing around! Don't get all serious on me now, Emerl! You... You think this is goodbye or something? Hey! Come on, Emerl! Let's go play! Everyone is waiting for us back home! Tails! And even Shadow and Knuckles!
Hey, I know! We can trick Knuckles into doing some stupid stuff again! We'll go home and... and... we'll all laugh and have a good time!!!! Right, Emerl...? Emerl!!!!!!!!
Emerl has... disappeared...
Come on, don't cry! Emerl is right here!

# Shadow the Hedgehog

Now that was sweet, Shadow!
Thought you might say something like that! How about a little friendly competition?
Guess that means... welcome to the next level. Let's go! 
Woohoo! Now we're talking!! Bring it on!!!
Nice to see you too. Looks like those black creatures are headed out to space. We're on our way to the ARK, so I guess that means we're going too.
Come on, let's roll. Next stop, the ARK.
Looks like the party's getting started, time to rock and roll! You up for this, Shadow?
Shadow! I can't let you go... not like this!
Shadow... What are you going to do with them?
Shadow... Why? Why are you siding with them?
Once every 50 years, that Black Comet passes by this planet. Oh! Do you think those black creatures are somehow connected with that comet?
Shadow! What's wrong?!
Hehehe... If that's how it's going to be, Shadow. Then bring it on!
So you're behind all this!... Like it or not... the game's over!
Shadow, give me the Chaos Emeralds!
You're our only hope now!
Shadow... That was SWEET!

I'm also concerned about that mysterious girl you saw, too.
You know, when Knuckles is angry... It's always difficult to talk to him.
Blaze... So that's your name.
S-Sure. Amy, have you seen Eggman, or a cat girl called Blaze?
Hey, chill for a second. You're way too tense.
Stop it, this isn't going to change anything!
Carrying the entire world on your shoulders?
A bit overzealous, aren't we? (But it seems like she's had a rough past.) Listen, don't bite off more than you can chew. And be yourself.
Great! I am Sonic. Sonic the Hedgehog. It's nice to meet you.
Man, things sure are looking depressing lately.
Blaze, you stay here. In your condition, you...
And Blaze, you've learned to open up and trust... To trust your friends!
As long as you have the power of friendship, the Sol Emeralds... will never lose their glow!
I guess it's time to say... good bye. Cream will really miss you.
You need to be true to yourself!
Everything should be fine since I have the seven Chaos Emeralds. As long as the person holding the emeralds can control them... And knows how to use them, nothing can go wrong. And Blaze... Now you have the power. You understand what I mean, right?

# Sonic Riders

Hey, that's...! The EX World Grand Prix, huh? Let's do this!
Yeah! How can she just walk in and diss Tails?
Hmm... Well I don't think he's all talk, you know; I better be on my toes during this competition.
Hey Tails, you always do your best, so don't worry.
Is that what you think? Take a look at this! I'll show you what true speed really is!
Even without wings, I can still fly! Right?
Well, Amy... I thought... it'd be... okay... with you, and, uh...

# ------------------------------
# Sonic the Hedgehog (2006)
# ------------------------------
My... That's a pretty snazzy performance there.
I'm Sonic. Sonic The Hedgehog!
OK! With your help, this should be a piece of cake.
Your smile... That's all I need.
Don't worry! Just raise your head and run!
Nothing starts until you take action. If you have time to worry, then run!
Thanks, Amy. I appreciate it.
Since Eggman went to the trouble of telling me where Elise is, I think I should thank him personally.
Okay, Shadow. It looks like we need to work together.
If we don't return in time, Elise will die onboard Eggman's battleship. That means...
Don't be late.
Those two can take care of themselves.
That was a gutsy move back there!
It sounds like being a Princess isn't that easy.
Silver. I can handle this myself. Besides, you've got somewhere to go, right?
I'll make sure to change Elise's fate. And that in turn, should change your future, too. Thank you, Silver!
The present-day... The here and now that you've stolen... Time to take it back!
Elise. Just smile.

# Sonic Rivals

Yo Silver... you're starting to get on my nerves!
Hey, what're you doing!? Wha-!
Where am I!? Looks like we've been transported to a completely different location...
Hey, look, it's Shadow!? Now I get it, he must be looking for Eggman too. It must be another race to see who can catch him first! Let's do it!
Heh. Looks like I've left Shadow clear in the dust. Guess he's really not as fast as he thinks.
Eggman said something about the strongest and fastest... What's he up to?
Ah ha! Looks like I've caught up to him again! Hey, Silver! We meet again!
Heh! While you've been wasting your time, I've been figuring his next move...
If you can keep up, I might tell you what I know! Let's go!
Okay, Eggman! I've proven that I'm the fastest and the strongest! So hand over Tails' card now!
Sorry about that, Knuckles, but if you're trying to stay on Eggman's heels, you have to be quicker than that.
You can't run, Eggman! No matter where you try to hide, I'll always track you down.
What, that lame robot copy of yours again? You really need to get ahold of some better toys, you know.
A copy is still just a copy! It'll never be able to top the original!
Then let's do this, Shadow!
About time you showed, Shadow! I'll give you a hand too!
Hey! You sure have an attitude. Who are you, anyway?
Well look who it is... Knuckles and Rouge! You two on a date or something?
Knuckles, don't tell me you're tired already?!
Ifrit? What's up with Eggman reading stuff like this? Come on, Tails! Let's get outta here!
Hey, Silver! Long time, no see. Guess you're looking for Eggman too, huh?
Ha... You never change, do you? Guess I'll have to find Eggman before you do!
Not too bad, Silver, but I don't have time for games right now,
I got a bad feeling about this, Tails! Whenever Metal Sonic's involved, it always means trouble!
I finally caught up to you, Shadow! What's going on?
Not so fast! What do you want with Knuckles and Rouge? And why are you with Metal Sonic?
Bet we can destroy it before you can, Shadow.
Espio! When did you...?
It looks like Eggman's been possessed by a ghost, too. Okay, Tails. It looks like it's up to us to knock some sense into him!
What the...? Tails? He's gotta be under... mind control! Great! Now I've got to take on the Ifrit AND Tails! Wait! Tails isn't totally under its control, but still... I've got to take them both on!
I guess the Ifrit wasn't really as strong as it was cracked up to be.

# Sonic Riders: Zero Gravity
# ----------------------------
What's going on? Is this the stone's power? Heheh! YAHOOOOOOOOOO!
Hey, hold up a minute. Girls hate guys who rush them, Jet.
Looks like we'll have to do the reunion later. See ya, Jet!
Was there an earthquake in here?
The Eggman Land project again, huh? He never gives up, does he?
Running away? Who do you think I am? I'll be waiting... See you at the World Grand Prix.

# ------------------
# Sonic Unleashed
# ------------------
Wuh-oh!
Well, this is new. Showing remorse, Eggman? If you played nice, I wouldn't have to break all your toys.
You've really... gone and done it this time, Eggman.
Mister... Monster guy? Looks like things have gotten pretty ugly.
I'm Sonic. Sonic the Hedgehog. And you are?
Hey, don't worry! I'll help you get your memory back.
What do you figure THAT was all about? The hair, and those arms, and... And look at the Chaos Emeralds.
Yeah, this is the REAL me! Pretty cool, huh?
If you say so... How about you give me a hand and help look for somebody who knows you, Chip?
So, when the sun goes down, I turn into... this?
I'm fine... I just need to be careful who sees me like this.
You know me. Never a dull moment.
I need to find Eggman and make him fix this, and FAST!
Spagonia? That's a continent over. An easy jog, if the planet weren't broken.
Let's get out of here before Eggman's welcome committee shows up.
Yo, Eggman. Thanks for that little skydiving adventure the other day!
A planet-sized jigsaw puzzle? Sounds like a great excuse to see the world!
Scared? It's just another old temple. It doesn't look like there's anyone around either.
Even at night, when I'm like this, I'm still myself, not like all the other people we've seen. You must have been protecting me this whole time.
Where do you think you're off to all by yourself?
Do I need a reason to want to help out a friend?
I'll never understand Eggman's tastes.
He's enjoying this way too much.
Chip. R-Run, Chip!
Roger that, buddy! Time for the big finale!

# Sonic Free Riders
# -------------------
Feelin' good! I'm looking forward to seeing the sights as I tear through such a beautiful town.
Heh, well of course! I know you'll do it better than anybody else!
Smells more like Egg than fish to me. He should just come out and challenge us. I'll take him on any time.
Wait, why do I owe you a date for winning a race?
You sure you're not just imagining things, buddy?
Jet! Why am I not surprised to see you in the finals?
This whole thing smells fishy.
This is a lame stunt, even for you, Eggman.
Hey, uh... Does he look funny to you?
Yeesh. My job would be easier if you shot down your own plots like this more often.
Uh... Yeah. Anyway, it sounds like we all managed to have fun.
I'll put an end to this with the next round. He can get plenty of rest after that.
You've improved, Shadow. Next time, it's my turn to surprise you.
Are you crazy? I gave that race all I had...

He loves to hear his own lips flap, but I gotta hand it to the Eggster, this place is epic. Everyone and their brother is gonna want to come here.
Because Eggman plus secretly built amusement park equals evil plot for us to foil. Lucky for us he's not very good at keeping things hidden.
I can't believe somebody was dumb enough to leave the keys in this thing! It's like Eggman's begging us to sneak in and trash the place.
Yep. That's pretty much how we spend our time.
Who you calling "nothin'"?
I did a little shopping, grabbed a bite to eat, and trashed a giant killer robot.
Yeah, uh... I think your machine still has some bugs.
Experience has also taught me that the best way to solve problems is to kick robot butt.
Wha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Baldy Nosehair?! That's the best thing that I've heard all day! I gotta remember that one.
Hey, Tails. You missed the BBBE. Best Boss Beating Ever!
What have you done to him?
Come on, Tails! Snap out of it, dude. You don't want to do this.
HAHAHA! Pay up Tails. I told you he had an evil plot and coming here was a good idea. There it is straight from the horse's mouth.
Hmmm, he is pretty gassy. Maybe the smell would knock 'em out. I dunno, something doesn't seem right with that.
Nobody said there'd be math, but I'm with you, buddy!
Once I start moving, I don't need much time.
You know, as alien as this place is, there is something very... Eggmanish about it.
Eggman! I AM going to save this planet, and I AM going to free these aliens. No copyright law in the universe is going to stop me. We can save a lot of time and broken robots if you just quit now!
For a second there I wasn't sure I was going to pull it off. Oh who am I kidding, we both knew how this would end.
Uh, maybe. That's between me and the robot. See, the important thing here is the alien planet is free.
So we can just forget about the whole talking to dead robots thing, right?
Touché.
Man, running past all those fish put me in the mood for sushi. I doubt Eggman had the decency to put a good sushi joint in this park.
You know me. I aim to please.
You know, I don't like what you're doing to my friends in there. It's messed up. So I'm gonna mess you up.
Yeah, that's right. I'm stretching. You got a problem with that? I wanna be able to fully enjoy taking you apart without some pulled muscle slowing me down. Okay, now I'm ready. Of course, if you want to run away, please feel free.
Yeah! Let's go to an amusement park or something!
The middle? We ARE the party. I think we're their guests of honor.
When I feel the ground shaking under my feet and see plumes of dust rising and rubble tumbling and aliens running for their lives, yeah, I get a bad feeling. So, how about you and me make like Eggman's hairline and recede?
I know you're trying to be clever with this whole amusement park pun thing, but it's just coming off lame. Say you're going to destroy us and stop embarrassing yourself.
A hedgehog's got to do what a hedgehog's got to do.
You're welcome. Thank YOU for saving us.

Hey, gimme a little room to breathe here! What's with you guys, anyway?!
Stop that! Quit shoving! And hey, that tickles!
What the—? Whoa, it's kinda like... I've got some kind of new power!
I'm pretty busy myself. Sorry, but I'll have to cut play time short!
Nice! That sounds fun. Maybe I'll go singe off Eggman's ugly mustache!
Heh, Knuckles? I don't know, this guy looks even more dangerous to me.
All right, got it. Time to go on a rampage with our new friend!
No problem! I'll have all of you free before Eggman can do a thing!
I'm happy to play, but count me out if there's water involved...
Aw, this is nothing. And a little bit of exercise is healthy!
If we're peas in a pod, I need to be sure to set a good example! Let's go!
Rgh, if they want to play rough... I'll get rough!
Yeesh. A little lady should be more careful around strange machines.
That was just a warm-up. You should see me when I really get going!
Those two robots really are as dense as their master...
Only you could sympathize with one of Eggman's robots, Cream.
Getting into trouble, then. Which is what I should be doing now, too!
Heh, will do. I've got this world's problems covered, guys!
He's right. Your biggest strength is in how simple you are. All this heavy thinking isn't like you.
Just try not to push yourself too hard, man.
Ninjutsu, huh? Sorry, but I think that path's a bit too narrow for me.
Nope. Didn't see him. I guess it was a dumb idea to work off a lead I got from Chaotix.
Hey, Big! You come all the way up here looking for your pal?
I'm having an off day.
Knock yourself out, but you won't understand how I run using math.
Light speed? That's small time. There's no challenge!
Ugh, this planet's all gloomy. I'll be happy to get out of here.
See that? That was true ultimate speed!
I'm going, I'm going. Later, Shadow!

Hey guys, what's going on? You having a party or something?
Is it me, or is that place we were just in awfully familiar?
No stranger than rescuing genies in magic books, or saving aliens in an interstellar amusement park. I'm more concerned about finding our friends.
Another Sonic?! What!?!
I can't believe there's two of me.
Then I guess we have to run like there's no tomorrow, or there won't be a tomorrow!
An adventure's no fun if it's too easy.
No, seriously, we beat this guy every time. It's like it's our job or something!
Okay, whatever you are. If you want to avoid an embarrassing beatdown, you'd better give up now!
Destroy me? You and what mustache? I beat you all the time by myself, and now there's two of me!
Time to scramble some Eggmen, SUPER SONIC STYLE!
It was great teaming up with you. Hope you learned a few tricks that will help you out in the future. I mean the past. You know what I mean.
Hey Sonic! Enjoy your future. It's gonna be great!

That's funny, because I know the perfect spot to kick you.
One word of helpful advice: diet and exercise.
Whatever! When is it a mistake to take your toys away?
I hate to run away from a fight, Tails, but I don't want to see you get fried.
Pffft, yeah well, teaming up with you feels like the end of the world, Eggman. I'm gonna want to take a long shower by the time we're done.
I do trust you, Tails. But the whole world's in danger because I did something stupid. Do you know how much that bites?
Oh my gosh, are you serious? I'm so, so sorry.
Oh no, what I meant to say is I am so sorry that you have nothing more important to do in life.
I can't figure you out. One second your contemplating genocide, and the next your saving one of your worst enemies.
I'm supposed to be the fastest, but I was too slow to save my buddy.
Orbot, no matter what happens, I won't fail again. I will save Tails.
Hey, you hurt one hair on his head...
I'm getting tired of you guys.
Sorry about that, Tails. I'll never doubt you again.
Y'know, after a day like today I could enjoy a nap on some fresh green grass.

# Sonic and the Secret Rings
# -----------------------------
Yaaaaawwn! Boy, is it that late already?
That definitely sounds like trouble. But, what do you want me to do?
Hmm. So, this guy needs someone to put him in his place, does he? I suppose I can help out with that. It might even be fun. But... this is all just something out of a storybook, right? How am I supposed to do anything about that?
OUCH! Hey, take it easy!
Achoo! Achoo! How about a handkerchief for starters! Make that a few!
Thanks! You're a lifesaver. You see, I caught this cold, yesterday, and...
Okay, okay. Thanks for the hankies, though.
Quit it, will you! My name's Sonic. Sonic the Hedgehog!
Alright... let's go! Take me to this world of the Arabian Nights!
What's that all about... talk about close shaves... Maybe you know where I could get my quills sharpened, too?
Don't you know anything? I'm not a rat! I'm a hedgehog.
And hey, don't look so glum, Shahra! I'll have you smiling by the end of this. And that's not me ordering you as your master. That's a promise from me to you.
Me? Legendary? You've got to be kidding! You're gonna make me blush!
Say what?! I'm supposed to be a sacrifice?
Hahaha. Hey, don't worry about it. Besides, don't you know how fast I am? Time may fly, but I'm even faster!
Don't sweat it! Anyways, no adventure is fun if it's too easy, right? Although it would have been nice if your magic DID work, in any case...
And enough of that RAT stuff... seriously! I'm a hedgehog! HEDGE-HOG!
Wisdom... Knuckles? ? Ah, never mind. Come on, let's find that key!
WOW! The wisdom of Sinbad of the Seven Seas! The adventurer of adventurers!
First a fire genie, and now pirates, huh? The Arabian Nights really are worlds of endless adventures, aren't they?
Yeah. I'm fine. Ok... alright. Just touching it makes me feel like I've got a whirlpool of emotions spiraling around inside me. I can't even begin to imagine what having all seven rings would do to someone.
Now, let's go back and defeat that, um... whatchamacallit.
I feel... rage. All that rage must have been sealed up inside of him.
Hehehe. Looks like my time limit is about up.
Sorry. I don't mean to worry you. ...I'll be okay.
Really. Don't worry about it. Just remember my promise... The promise between me and you.
Shahra, stop! You can't do this! Think about what will happen!
Shahra?! Wh-what's...?
No! As Genie of the Ring, I command you! "Do what you truly think is right!"
Shahra! Grant me a wish! I wish for you to not die and to go back to the way you were!
This is awful. You're just some incomplete monster...
My third wish. Erazor Djinn! You shall live out the rest of time, trapped inside your lamp as you were in days of old!
Shahra... Will you grant me one more wish? I wish for a mountain of handkerchiefs.
Now, just let yourself cry as much as you need to. You'll have plenty of handkerchiefs to help you through it.

# Sonic and the Black Knight
# -----------------------------
Oh, I get it. No problem! I'm used to stuff like this!
You mean like big ol' haunted house? Ha ha! This'll be cool! It'll be like Halloween all year long!
Guess I can't be the hero every time.
Yeah, well it's got pretty smart mouth on it for a sword.
Well, it's your fault! You're a sad excuse for a teacher!
Stop calling me "knave"! I'm Sonic the Hedgehog!
Whatever, you oversized letter opener.
Heh! Not the sharpest tool in the shed, huh?
Gentleman? Who are you calling "gentleman"?
Great. Think you could you sharpen this dull piece of rust?
Heh! I'm the world's fastest hedgehog! Check it out! You'll be calling me "Sir" before you know it!
Yeah, maybe, but... I play by my own rules. Remember that.
I don't suppose you're gonna let me by? Heh! You look just like this knucklehead I know!
Gimme a break! What's up with all this drama?! Isn't there more to being a knight than just serving a king?
I'm Sonic! Sonic the Hedgehog! I have no master except the wind that blows free!
I guess you could say that whim is my other master.
Enough of that "knave" stuff already!
I'm Sonic the Hedgehog, Knight of the Wind! Let's settle things once and for all, King Arthur!
Listen. It's like I said before... Isn't there more to being a knight than serving a king?
What good is a world that goes on forever!?
A knight... never... flees... his foe, right?
It was never about chivalry for me... I just gotta do what I've gotta do, that's all.
I already told you, I don't mind playing the bad guy every once in a while.
Merlina... Every world has its end. I know that's kinda sad, but... That's why we gotta live life to the fullest in the time we have.
But man! Who'd have thought I was the real King Arthur? Heh.
No, no! It's true, I tell ya! Yikes! No Amy, wait! Put down that hammer!

Oh hey, sounds like the party's started. Want to let me go and join in? No? Of course not, you hate fun.
The only thing inevitable here is my foot kicking your butt.
Oh, sure, don't even bother to ask how I am.
Your concern is touching, Knuckles.
I've got six months of payback I'm just dying to spend. This sounds like a good start!
Time to tag out, Silver! I've got it from here!
That's not fear, I ran all the way over here. And you haven't left an impression. I don't know anything about you! Not even your name.
Great! See, Infinite, now we're getting to know each other! So, what's your favorite color? Do you like long, romantic walks on the beach? What's the source of your power? You can skip the first two questions if you like.
Sorry, but you've just GOT to share the secret of your power with me. I insist! 
Great job! I knew you could do it if you believed in yourself!
You worry too much. Look, I'm perfectly fine.
Ah, it's been generations since I've seen you. You okay?
Shadow... The last time I saw him, he was fighting for Eggman.
Of course we can win this! We always do! We just haven't figured that part out, yet.
Hey, don't be scared! This is your moment to shine! Keep going. Don't let your fear own you!
Hey! That was great! We were like a well-oiled machine... fighting a well-oiled machine.
Maybe by myself, but I had a little help from my friend. Something you wouldn't understand, since you don't have any friends!
Hey, Infinite! Long time no see! Did you miss me?
I'm in a class all my own. Time to put-up or shut up, Infinite!
Wrong, loser! The things that can't be defeated are heart, soul, and the bonds of friendship. Three things you and your counterfeit cronies lack!
Oh, come on! Now what? Can't we ever just win and have that be the end of it?
Hey, you're taking off, too? I was thinking the same thing. You gonna keep moving forward? No matter what, yeah? Heh, you and I aren't so different.
Good thing we're not normal. We'll find a way through!
Green Hill's looking a lot more like Sand Hill right now.

C'mon, you know you'll all be safe as long as I'm around!
Ha Ha! That was awesome! As much as I like to run, it was really fun to drive this thing!
Hey, Silver. Long time no see. You came here from the future?
Say no more. That's good enough for me. You'll tell me when I need to know.
Yeah, it's a mystery. I wonder if Shadow knows anything. He'd work with Eggman if it meant getting what he wanted. I think I'll have a little chat with him.
Fair enough. You could never beat me anyway. Oh, and don't worry, I'll stop Eggman for you.
Tell you what, how about I challenge you to a race to see who's the best?
I like the plan. The "keep racing" part is my favorite. Shadow is going down!
Race you to see who can take care of Eggman's toys the quickest, Shadow!
Like you're about to get your car fed to you by a blue hedgehog? No, never.
Wow dude, you take all the fun out of trash talking.
Where's the fun in that? You don't win by stopping. You win by GOING.
What? Tails, we gotta go save Dodon Pa! Tails, Silver, Rouge, Chao - grab the guys who can't fly and get out of here!

"Key", huh? Sure beats being called a "rodent". Are you saying I can rescue my friends?
Yeah, okay, sure... How about a little context? Hello?
Eh. I've been infused with weird zappy stuff before. Besides, I feel like it gave me some kind of boost!
"Careful"? Where's the fun in that?
You hanging in there, Amy? Is your condition... well, I don't know... uncomfortable?
You're tough. I know you'd have hung in there. Still, I'm glad I could get you out. And I'm not gonna stop until you're back to normal!
Hang in there, Amy. I'll figure something out.
Yeah. I'll try not to have TOO much fun finding a way to restore you!
Yeah! They're ancient, but also look kinda advanced? Wait, is "retro-sci-fi" a thing?
Okay. I'm not taking that thing down the traditional way. I'm gonna need the Chaos Emeralds, and maybe a little bit of luck.
Why are we enemies!? Weird kid. I don't really get a bad vibe off of her, though.
Well, you always had a knack for weird insights. Who am I to argue?
I would think we've got more pressing issues, but... again, who am I to argue?
I dunno. I guess I'm just that awesome! Yea. Although, I bet you'd have better insight on that.
Wow, thanks for the encouragement. Well, I'll keep doing it until I figure out how to rescue Amy!
It doesn't matter if this is all one big trap, or if you keep throwing weird robots at me, nothing is going to slow me down or stop me. Count on it!
Care to explain how saving my friends is a bad thing?
No, but I'm also worried about you. You can't help anyone if you're stuck in limbo.
I know you'll do great. I want to hear all about it when you come back.
Okay, okay, so you're not in a talking mood. I'll leave you be.
Nah. That's cool. I didn't want this to be easy anyway.
Never a dull moment with you.
That was a "warning"?
I have no idea what your deal is, but if we could just talk—
Whoa! Whoa! WHOA! Time-out!
But she's trying to protect something—or someone. I'm willing to help, but first I need to know what's going on.
Yeah, you make a great supervisor, Knux. Maybe try fighting next time, though?
Well, whatever. The spooky sky voice says I just have to trash the Titans to get you guys back to normal. So we have a plan.
You may be the last, but you're not alone. You've got us, Knucklehead.
So do it! Get out there and live a little.
Hang tight, little bro, I won't make you wait much longer.
Those sure are words you said just now!
I'll be fine. And I need this power to rescue you.
My name... My name is...?
You've got me worried. Tails, you want to talk?
If they want to start trouble, I'll stop them too.
Wow... And how did you come to this well-thought-out concern?
Hey! Who was it who stopped Eggman from blowing up Station Square, huh? And who broke me out of prison, or saved me from the Deadly Six's trap?
Dude, relax! You've got brains like Eggman, speed like me, and can fly with your butt.
It's okay if you still need help sometimes. That's just part of growing up.
And I'm proud of you. Don't forget that.
You're free to go your own way. I guess you just grew up on me a little faster than I expected.
It's gonna take some getting used to, but here's to you reaching new heights—partner.
Hey, I've seen my fair share of pinball machines. I know one when I see one. Were those really part of the original ruins? I mean, the tech here outpaces Eggman's and is older than "old". I guess the love of pinball predates civilization.
Sit tight, partner. I'll take out this last Titan and get everyone back to normal!
Everyone... thank you. I won't let you down.
I've figured out everything else up until now, haven't I? Don't sweat it.
You got it, Sage. Heh, we've run into each other so many times, but I only recently learned your name. You could have told me sooner, you know?
Sure it does! Eggman named you that for a reason. That means you're important to him.
Hey, if there's even a one percent chance I can turn that despair of yours into hope, I won't disappoint.
You're always talking about odds and simulations, but we living beings don't live by calculations.
The will to live, the drive to achieve, the desire to protect the ones you love - that kind of thing can grant a power you can't imagine.
Now why would I want to disappoint you?
He took your home world... He took your lives... Are you going to let him do it all over again?! I need your help. We can end this! Please!!
Big?! What are you doing here? HOW did you get here-? What even IS here?!
Eh. I guess it wouldn't hurt to de-tense for a second.
Look. Just take a second to tell me who you are, what's going on, and why you look like you want to smite me on the spot?
