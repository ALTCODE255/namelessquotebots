My name is Shadow. Since you were so kind to release me, my master... I will grant you one wish.
I'll be waiting for you, in the central control room, on the Space Colony ARK.
Maria...!
Maria... I still remember what I promised you... For all the people of this planet... I promise you... REVENGE!
It all starts with this... a jewel containing the ultimate power.
My name is Shadow. I'm the world's Ultimate Life Form. There's no time for games; farewell!
I've been waiting for you Doctor. Now, I will show the glorious achievement of what the world's leading scientist - Professor Gerald has created.
Not many people know that the ARK contained a top-secret research facility, where weapons of mass destruction were being created. This is one of them; a weapon capable of destroying an entire planet. Codenamed: "The Eclipse Cannon."
To reactivate the machine, we need the seven Chaos Emeralds. Once you have that, then you have the ultimate power of destruction, to use as you please. And then... the world could be yours.
I'm in position, doctor. Tell me when.
Ah... shoot. Troublemaker!
That blue hedgehog again, of all places!
Faker? I think you're the fake hedgehog around here. You're comparing yourself to me? Hah! You're not even good enough to be my fake.
CHAOS CONTROL!!
The professor said his life's work was dedicated to all of those who live down there. He once told that the reason for his existence was, making people happy through the power of science.
Maria... I just don't know anything anymore... I often wonder why I was created; what my purpose is for being here. Maybe if I go down there, I... I will find the answers... maybe...
Hmm, you know... I didn't come to save you. I came back for the Chaos Emeralds.
That's more than enough for the demonstration. So let's get this show on the road!
Our threats fell on deaf ears.
Soon enough... Maria...
Doctor, they're heading directly toward us. What should we do?
I guess he was just a regular hedgehog after all.
So that was your plan from the very beginning, huh? Or was it a direct order from the president? Now I know who you are! You're that government spy, Rouge the Bat, aren't you?
You are one pathetic creature!
If you want to live, leave the Chaos Emeralds where they are; the fake Emerald is good enough for you!
Even if my memories are not real, it's still me, Shadow. And I will fulfill my promise to Maria. That's the only thing that matters to me now.
You never cease to surprise me, blue hedgehog. I thought that the capsule you were in exploded in space.
So, there's more to you than just looking like me. What are you anyway?
I see. But you know, I can't let you live. Your adventuring days are coming to an end.
It's all going according to plan. There's no reason for me to help them. Besides, there's no way to save anyone.
That's what I've promised her... I must keep that promise... That's what Maria wished for...
I gotta go now. I have to keep my promise to Maria - and you.
I'll take care of this, while you run to get the Chaos Emeralds!
Is that what... Chaos Control is?
Chaos Control!!
Maria... this is what you wanted, right? This is my promise I made to you...
Maria... watch me. I will fulfill your wish!
Sonic, I think I've discovered what the ultimate life form is... it might be you!

# Sonic Heroes

Look, it's that hedgehog...
Is that so... well then, it'll be a date to DIE for!
Hmph! Hope you can keep up with me!
Tell me, Doctor! What was I doing... asleep on that base? And what about my memory?
Capture him first, then you can have your revenge, Omega.
That blue hedgehog like me... What did the doctor say about my memory... And just who am I?
You'll regret this, doctor... Even if I'm not real, I'm still the ultimate life form... Shadow the Hedgehog!
This is the end of the line, doctor!
Sonic, we're counting on you!
Hah, some things never change, do they?
Cool city.
'Sonic'... Why does that name... bother me so much?
Omega, break this rock.
Just what... am I?
Space... Did you say space?

# Sonic Battle

Huh? Sonic the Hedgehog... Sorry, but I don't have time to play with you now.
Hey! Can you hear me? Respond! No! You must have already established a Link!
Won't listen to me, eh? In that case, I'll destroy you with my bare hands!
Get out of the way, and give me that robot!
Gah... I still haven't regained my full power yet. Listen to me! Whatever you do, don't let Dr. Eggman get hold of the Gizoid. I'll be back... Until then, take care of it... Sonic the Hedgehog!
Looks like you discovered what Emerl really is...
Then why don't you destroy it now? You must destroy it before it collects all the Chaos Emeralds and uses its true power!
There's no need to repeat past tragedies! Nobody else ever needs to go through the things that I have! Out of the way! I'll finish it now!
Hmph. Looks like you'll never understand. The builders will never know how their creations truly feel.
I didn't push myself much...
There it is again... I feel it... Someone's talking to me...
Tragedy? What tragedy?
You... Rouge. What are you doing here?
What's so funny?
Doctor... Must not repeat... the tragedy...!
Ally...
I must go. I must go to the Gizoid. To the Emerald.
Thanks, Rouge... Thanks for saving me. I cannot allow myself to die just yet.
Sonic the Hedgehog... Where is Emerl?!
I'm not here to steal him. I'm here to welcome him, as a fellow weapon of war.
Haven't you noticed? His awakening as the legendary weapon of war Gizoid is close at hand.
Right now, its true power lies dormant. However, I can feel it. I can feel the power... A power greater than you can imagine.
Dangerous? Ha! He's a weapon. One created with enough power to destroy the world. Awakening him is sheer madness!
Hmph! No, you are wrong. We were created as weapons. If the people of this world ever want peace, they must destroy us.
Ha! Such hopeless dreams... Weapons have no need for a conscience. Freedom? What use is a weapon that does not follow orders?!
I have a different kind of Link with Gizoid. Like me, he's a weapon! No doubt about it! He's a weapon to be used by his Master!
Heh... Perhaps now you believe me. He was created as a weapon. You were lucky in that you met him before he awakened. But, you cannot deny the Gizoid's true identity!
Hmm. I, too, have things that I wish to speak to Dr. Eggman about. Let's go, Emerl. So begin your path to ruin.
It appears that the good doctor thinks I'm his enemy...
Fool... Emerl, do you see? This is the fate for weapons of war.
Can't move any more... Let's go... Night Babylon is just ahead of the doctor's lab.
The doctor's Mother Computer... I never imagined that I'd be here again... Tell me... What am I? What is the Gizoid? We were created as weapons, so why is it that we have hearts? Why do we have souls?! What the heck are we?!
Why did Gerald give me a soul?!
"Bring hope to humanity," huh? Kinda touching. How do we input the code?
It's all right. I... I will always be with Maria.
Emerl! Take it! This is the last Chaos Emerald!
Gizoid, ancient weapon of legend. I, as your new master, command you: "Bring hope to humanity"!
Hmph. Look who's talking. You remind me a little too much of a certain spikey, smug little...
You're free now. Eggman no longer will no longer have any control over you.
Let us battle, one last time, to see who truly is the strongest! ...My body wasn't healed completely before, but now I'm ready! I am the ultimate life form, Shadow the Hedgehog. I will crush anyone who stands in my way!
I no longer need it. I have Maria in my heart.
Yeah. Tell them you're not a kid anymore. Once you've fought them all, come back and see me. We'll finish our fight then. I'll be at Central Highway. I'll be waiting!
Heh... I shall concede that you are my equal.
Hmph. You're just as mouthy as him, too. Looks like we've got a guest. Come back later.
Yep, you sound exactly alike.
Hmph! There's no need for a weapon to have feelings. ...This is ridiculous! I am leaving!
No! Now I understand what's going on. The Doctor planned this all along!!
I am... no longer... You must go... Sonic...
This is the final voice of the last war machine... So begins the destruction of the earth... A natural result of ignorant human desires and greed...
This was Gerald's final program... Should a weapon go out of control, the weapon will terminate itself... It is my desire to bring hope to humanity. I can't stand it...

# Shadow the Hedgehog
# -------------------------
Shadow the Hedgehog... Why does that name haunt me? It's the only thing I can remember. And that gruesome image...
Who am I... and why can't I remember anything? And who is this Maria?
Hmm, look how pathetic they are! I don't have time for these humans.
Out of my way! Coming through!
No one tells me what to do. I have my own reasons for collecting the Chaos Emeralds.
Yeah... Well, I'm not here to save you!
Look... I don't take orders... especially from you. But I'm not here to fight you, either. I'm collecting the Emeralds to find my own answers, so why don't you just back off?!
Doctor! I don't want to fight with you, but I need those Chaos Emeralds. They hold the secret to my...
Whaa...!? That's right. I somehow escaped but then was captured by those humans. But... from where? And why?
Where's that damn FOURTH Chaos Emerald!?
This is just too easy. Guess it's my lucky day!
Hatred and contempt... for the humans.
Whaaat?!
The ARK? 50... years ago?
Those heartless humans! Get out of my way!
I bet no one expected this baby could fly.
Hmm... well, what a coincidence. I'd like to know what the good old doctor's up to as well. Hiiyaaa!!!
Doctor, please tell me. I need to know about my past. Who am I? What am I doing here?
Having a little trouble with those GUN agents... are we?
You scum! You're going down!
Huh? What the...!? [Does a back flip] How can this be? Who are you?!?
Shadow... Android? Am I... an... android... too?
Doctor, please I need to know... those androids... the ones that... look like me, am I...
Space Colony, ARK... this place... so familiar... but why? This is... where I...
Maria... died?
A Chaos Emerald? You've gotta be kidding me, guys! This is like taking candy from a baby, which is fine by me.
I'll be there, Maria. I swear, whatever it takes, I'll take care of the ARK and the professor!
I know, professor... The ultimate life form born to ensure peace and justice amongst all of mankind. Now, I know what I have to do.
I know what I have to do. I was born to bring order to the humans. These humans... they don't value life... they're going to pay... pay with their lives for what they've done!
Sonic! If you try to stop me... I'll destroy you too!
I'm Shadow... the Hedgehog. I was created to bring order and justice to the humans. With the power of these Emeralds, I'm going to DESTROY THIS DAMN PLANET! THIS IS WHO I AM!
Only ONE Chaos Emerald left!
Yeah, well, I told you... no one tells me what to do. I need these Emeralds to uncover the truth about my past.
I'm Shadow the Hedgehog, the ultimate lifeform born to rule all! With the power of these Emeralds, I'm going to conquer the universe. THIS IS WHO I AM!
I'm Shadow the Hedgehog, the ultimate life form born to protect and serve the dark lord, Black Doom. With the power of these Chaos Emeralds, this world will become the dark empire. This is WHO I AM.
I am Shadow the Hedgehog. I and only I know what is best. No one can tell me what to do. THIS IS WHO I AM!
Goodbye, doctor!!
The pieces are coming together, this "ultimate life form" they keep referring to is the black hedgehog and he... died... and I'm its copy. I must be the android Dr. Eggman created. Then it's clear what needs to be done!
Doctor... You're going straight to the place you created me from!
I didn't collect them to hand them over to you. I collected them to destroy YOU!
I am Shadow Android, the ULTIMATE life form... A copy of Shadow the Hedgehog. With the power of these Emeralds, I will be stronger than him! THIS IS WHO I AM!
Yes Doctor, you will regret ever having created me... you're going straight to hell!
I am Shadow Android. The ultimate battle life form created by Eggman. You may have created me, doctor, but I will now lead this empire and androids will rule! THIS IS WHO I AM!
Damn it! What does it all mean? These memories... the doctor's actions and words... nothing makes sense! Was it real?
If what you say is true, then I will respectfully accept my fate.
This is something I must do I my own... I must uncover the truth. I made a promise to all the victims aboard the ARK!
I am Shadow the Hedgehog. The ultimate life form born and raised aboard the ARK! I shall live on... I am the protector of the ARK... I am living proof of the ultimate life form... This is who I am.
Leave now, and never return! I won't allow anyone to violate the sacred ARK!
If that's true, then I'll have to accept my responsibilities for my crimes. I will avenge the victims who died aboard the ARK on that tragic day.
I am Shadow the Hedgehog. A research experiment... gone deadly wrong! I've caused so much destruction... I should never have been created... This is who I am...
Siding with them... you're joking, right? I'm just siding with whoever goes up against you! This time you're going down, Sonic!
I'm Shadow the Hedgehog... and now I am the most powerful hedgehog in the world! The power of these Emeralds makes me invincible! I am the ultimate hedgehog... THIS IS WHO I AM!
Black Doom! Your rule ends here and it ends now!
It's you who should be scared, Black Doom! I made a promise to Maria to save the planet she loved so much... and I WILL!
I'm Shadow the Hedgehog, and I made a promise that I intend to keep! With the power of these Emeralds, Black Doom and his army are finished! THIS IS WHO I AM!
Did I... die?
I am Shadow the Hedgehog. I've left the past behind me. No one can tell me what to do now! I will destroy you, Black Doom!!
I've heard enough! You're boring me to death, Black Doom! You're going down!
You have no control over me, Black Doom! I now understand why I am here... I made a promise and I'm here to keep it! Today, I put my past behind me!
Goodbye forever... Shadow the Hedgehog.

I'm Shadow. Shadow the Hedgehog.
My assignment was to rescue you, nothing more.
Mephiles... Who is he?
It appears we've gone through time... doesn't it?
His power feels very similar to my own Chaos Control, but...
Why are you here? Did you ruin this world?
That's absurd. Whatever it is you want to do, you can do it alone.
I determine my own destiny.
I can handle this alone. You keep track of Mephiles.
Don't bother. With a Chaos Emerald's power, I control time and space. You can't break free.
Mephiles isn't trying to help you create a better future... He's trying to eliminate the past.
To discover what happened, it seems we must see what took place 10 years ago. Follow me if you want the truth.
Don't try to deceive me.
You have no desire for revenge. You only crave destruction. Your only lust is to fuel Iblis until there is nothing left of time itself.
If the world chooses to become my enemy, I will fight like I always have!
Certainly, it might have been possible, if he was still alive.
I will release you from the chains of your past.

Sonic! What are you doing here? And where's the doctor?
I need you to find the truth! I'll help you, Sonic!
You let the doctor get away? Hmph! You're useless...
Whatever, Knuckles... But first, I've got some business with the doctor!
You're on! Let's do it!
Maybe not, but at least I'm not as clueless as you. I'll see you later!
Huh? What's this... A silver hedgehog? And... he's chasing... the doctor!? Hey, you! What do you want with the doctor!?
My name is Shadow... And I won't let you harm the doctor!
What? Why are you...
Hmm, guess this was just a waste of my time...
!? This light!? What's going on!?
Hmph! I have no time for card games!
I'll figure out what's going on later... Now, hand over that card!
Hmph! There's no way I'm losing to some android fake. I accept your challenge!
Whatever! Now, why don't I show that fake why they call me the Ultimate Life Form!
What's the matter? Nowhere left to run?
What!? Change the future? Is that what you've been trying to do? Hmm... I won't let you get away with that!
Hmph! Is that a question?!
Sonic!? Heh, just stay outta my way.
Hmph... There's no way I'd lose to someone like him who blames their own failures on the past.
Do what you like...

# Sonic Free Riders
# -------------------
Heh, agreed. I'd suggest you beat us before getting excited.
Hmph. Don't blame your own poor performance on my teammate.
Ugh. We lost to them? This is ridiculous...
They have no idea how unfortunate they are.
All right, enough playing around.
This is some kind of mistake. How could I lose?
I've no interest in these formalities.
Pageantry aside, we're here to win. You can be sure of that.
Three person team? I could have won that by myself.
Well, for a random robot we picked up off the street, I'd say he's doing pretty well.
I'll put an end to YOU. Now let's be done with this!
No matter how many times you try, you can't win.
Hey, you all right? Hold it together!
If you don't believe me, let's go again. This victory will be in honor of our fallen comrade.
How annoying. But I suppose we've no choice.
We were just waiting for your circus performance to end. We're ready.

You have a job to do. Go take care of the Doctor.
It's been awhile... Let me make sure you haven't gone soft, Sonic. 
Heh, looks like I don't need to be too worried.
Guess I overestimated you, Sonic.
Heh, back for more? You're a glutton for punishment. 
I've been waiting, Sonic.
Hmph. Disappointing haul for a promising lead.
Finally, a little peace and quiet.
I'm happy to leave the racing around all day to them, thanks.
That just goes to show that data won't tell you everything.
Come back when you're ready to get serious!
Quit wasting time gloating and go stop the Doctor, Sonic!

# Sonic and the Black Knight (technically Lancelot, not Shadow lol)

I have found you, apprentice knight, enemy of my King!
I am Lancelot, Knight of the Round Table. I challenge you to a duel!
What shall it be? Will you abandon your sword and flee?
Very well, then! Brace yourself, Knave the Hedgehog!
No, Sonic! There is no point in continuing!

Infinite can create virtual reality projections. They have mass and form, but no heart and soul.
Replicas. The problem is, they may not be real, but their powers are as formidable as the originals. According to Rouge, Infinite can create unlimited numbers of them.
Exactly. As it stands, there's no way we can win this.
This should effectively put a stop to the doctor's greatest weapon.
I can't imagine the doctor would do something like that without reason.
I'm more than enough on my own. I'll handle things my way.
Cut the chatter. I'm on my way.
Tell me what you did to Omega.
I don't know you. And the only thing of no consequence around here is that big mouth of yours.
Worthless. Don't show your pathetic face around me ever again.
?
Ngh. What? Where? I'm... back here? No. Is this an illusion!?
Sonic!? What are you plotting?
Rgh! Withdrawing now! What's the meaning of all this?
What is it, Rouge? What happened?

# Team Sonic Racing
# --------------------
I always try, and I ALWAYS succeed. I'm not here for you, and I'm not working with the Doctor. I'm here to put an end to his evil plans.
Hmph, Sonic, I'm the Ultimate Life Form. I could never lose to you.
Challenge accepted. Although there is no challenge!
Perhaps you could be useful in assisting me to thwart the Doctor's plan after all, Sonic.
Team Dark! Let's slag these robots!
You and I have some unresolved business, Sonic.
I wasn't talking about racing, Sonic. I was talking about the Doctor and his intentions.
